<h3>This website was produced as part of my coursework for Level 2 Digital Technologies. It shows evidence that I am able to advanced techniques to develop a website, and I can use the Design Process to develop a design.</h2>

<ul><li><p><b>I have used appropriate tools and techniques for the purpose and end users</b></br><!-- ul creates a list, li creates the bulletpoint !-->
For example, I have created a website using html/css with an external stylesheet. The material is structured and formatted using a range of tags and styles. It has clear headings, body text and lists/bullets if required.</p>

<li><p><b>I have applied appropriate data integrity and testing procedures.</b></br>
For example, the site has been tested/previewed either in two unrelated browsers.The text has been proof-read and there are no obvious spelling/grammatical issues.</p>

<li><p><b>I have used relevant conventions.</b></br>
For example, design elements such as contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity and white space to lay out their site</p>

<li><p><b>I have explained relevant implications.</b></br>
For example, I have explained why copyright should be honoured/images should be credited. I have mentioned why the site should be accessible for colour blind/visually impaired users. I have stated why their site should be easy to navigate (the site may have minor navigation issues).</p>


<li><p><b>I can define the purpose of the digital media outcome and the requirements of the end users.</b></br>
I investigated many examples to learn about website design and current design trends. I can generate and model a range of design ideas. For example, I have  created a series of possible site layouts. I have experimented with different colour, background and font options. I have sketched wireframes for the initial layout of the page followed by mockups showing various options.</p>

<li><p><b>I can explain relevant implications.</b></br>
For example, I have mentioned the importance of honouring copyright and privacy (e.g. getting permission from students whose photos appear in the site). I have explained why the site needs to be aesthetically pleasing, fully functional, easy to use and accessible.

<p>I made my site using repl.it  to script the html and css.</br> <img src="Photos/replit.png" alt="Repl.it Logo" width="150"></br>
I used W3schools as a reference.</br> <img src="Photos/W3schoolz.png" alt="W3Schools Website" width="250"></br></p>

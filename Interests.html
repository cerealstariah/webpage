<h4>Photography</h4>
<p>I've been into Photography for a few years now, I don't take photos with professional cameras as I don't have access to those resources, but I would like to learn how to frame photos correctly with professional software, along with camera angles, framing, photoshop etc.</br>

<h4>Game Devalopement</h4>
<p>Game Devalopement is something i've been interested in for a few years, I've looked into coding a small amount but not as much as I would've liked to. I've done a small amount of coding in Year9 at Whangarei Girls Highschool along with photoshop in Year10 and 11. I'm now continuing with coding through Year12 at Tauraroa Area School.</br>

<h4>Overwatch</h4>
<p>Overwatch is an online fps (first person shooter) game on quite a few platforms, but personally I play on PS4. One of my dream jobs is to become a game designer or devaloper with the company who made this game; Blizzard. I would love to help with the devalopement of this specific game also in the future.</p></br>
